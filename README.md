# Auto List of Documents

Change directory to where the auto_LOD.py file is installed.

To use this, make sure you have the required packaged installed. Use this command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change the lod_files_directory variable in the source code to where your files are.

Then run the script in the terminal:

```
python auto_LOD.py
```

You should have an automatically made List of Documents.
